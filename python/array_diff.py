'''
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
'''

def array_diff(a, b):
    return [e for e in a if e not in b]
